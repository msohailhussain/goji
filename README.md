# Data structures and algorithms Golang library
![](goji-image.jpg)

## Assumptions
1. Every pointer receiver method assume that the pointer is not nil
2. All assumption (if any) are specified in each function
3. Numbers ovewflow errors are not covered

## Limitations
This library is for general purpose, but I want to maintain it compatible with https://github.com/lorenzotinfena/competitive-go so all the code should respect the limitations explained in the library. Maybe in the future the limitations could become less strict.
